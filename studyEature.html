                    <h2> Scope and Objectives </h2>
                    <p> It starts with a single simple assignment, to make a prototype using our prefered development software. I wanted to make a small game prototype that appeals to all-ages with unique and rewarding gameplay (specifically needed innovation on the "mouse avoider" genre), and creative character designs and good animations. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Research and Data Gathering </h2>
                    <p> I realized a lot of games within the small mouse avoider genre follow the same template of simply having you mouse avoid different kinds of enemeies, so what should I do to change things up? I took some inspiration from an older game I made years ago that had the intriguing mechanic of a player that follows the mouse but can't touch it. I also had to research on using sine waves in GDevelop games as enemy paths. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Process Documentaion </h2>
                    <p> After making the propsal/wireframes and character concepts (each character design uses shapes/lines to visually show their movement path), I started using GDevelop to make the game and art, and Garageband to work on the loopable music during times I couldn't work on the game (like in transit). I had challenges with choosing an art direction, which I overcame by using 32x32 pixel art images for each character. </p>
                    <p> I began with working on the basic controls with the idea of expanded functionality like using the scroll wheel of the mouse to change speed to expand upon the genre. Next I worked on the different enemies and their spawning. I then finalized the character designs and music and drew out each character, collectable, and animation to finish things off. For fluid animations, I also made the speed of an animation correlate to an object's movement speed. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Results </h2>
                    <p> Not only did I complete my goals of making a challenging yet balanced game with finess that looks and plays good, but got above perfect marks by going above and beyond too. I also made a prototype that can be easily expaned upon (like with the scrapped enemy and power-ups for example). </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Reflection and Learnings </h2>
                    <p> Lots of aspects of the game turned out pretty well (like the gameplay, art, and music) but things that could've been done differently was adding more sound effects, making the game screen bigger, and making the small mouse hitbox more obvious. Things I learned from this project include how to turn sine waves into enemy movement and how to better stick to a set scope. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                    <p> To conclude, I was able to set and complete a clear scope for an innovative and fun game prototype in the mouse avoider genre that not only has great art and music, but also got superb marks with endless expandibility. Consider collabing to help bring EATure to its full potential? </p>
