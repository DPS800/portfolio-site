                    <h2> "No Internet Game" Game Jam </h2><br>
                    <p> Using the freetime I had during the summer, I decided to join my first game jam. The browser OperaGX hosted a summer game jam, where people were tasked to develop a small game that could be played when there was no internet while using the browser with a UFO theme in a few days on GameMaker Studio 2. I wanted to make a simple small game that could be played endlessly on a small screen while the user waits to get back online. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2> Games for Offline Moments </h2><br>
            <p> I found out that a lot of other offline browser gaming experiences were simple score-attack games in small screens that are accessible and start on the browser's "No Internet" screen, some even had original characters too. These were things I wanted to emulate. </p>
            <br><hr style="width: 10%;  margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></br>

            <h2> Swift Development </h2><br>
            <p> When I finish the character concept art, I started experimenting with the "alien" development software I never used before. I was able to find features like screen looping that I would later use in the finished game. Then after hectic gameplay has been made, I made the pixel art and animations, multiplayer, bugfixes, effects, and an intro screen starting on "No Internet". Neilaggs (name of the alien egg-like protagonists) Without Wi-Fi was complete and with time to spare! </p>
            
            <br></br>
            <h2> Jam Results </h2><br>
            <img src="../img/WFss1.jpg" alt="Neilaggs Without Wi-Fi game screenshot" style="width: 50%;"><br></br>
            <p> The jam rankings/results were never revealed, but the top contenders were given community voting polls. Even though I didn't win, I still created and chaotic and fun single and multiplayer that seems simple but is hard to master. Unknowingly to me, my game would later be featured on the professional game database site RAWG.io later on too. My first game jam experience was so good that I would later go on to make many more unique game jam game experiences. </p>
            
            <br><hr style="width: 10%;  margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></br>
            <h2> An Extraterrestrial Experience! </h2><br>
            <p> The simple gameplay and character designs went really well for my first jam, but maybe I could've adjusted the difficulty. The game got a lot of lovely feedback comments during the game jam that included feedback about how hard the game was, and I learned how fun and collaborative game jams could be, as well as how more creative you could be with each jam's limits. </p>
            
            <br></br>
            <h2> Departing the UFO... </h2><br>
            <p> In conclusion, I was able to create a delightful little no internet browser game experience for my first game jam that is still fun to play that lead to more fun jam games and got a surprised feature. Speaking of being featured, feel free to reach out for some more creative game concepts, with or without a theme! </p>
