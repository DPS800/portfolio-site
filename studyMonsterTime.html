                    <h2> Scope and Objectives </h2>
                    <p> In September our group was tasked to make a themed timeline with the past, present, and a predicted future. We chose the topic of the history of monster because the presentation date was on Halloween! Our plan was to pick 25 monsters (with 4 predicted future ones) that represented 4 different eras of monsters, while displaying them in a fitting way on a timeline. Can we pull of this horrific hijinx? </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Research and Data Gathering </h2>
                    <p> We needed to a lot of research and data gathering, not just on our select monsters and on themes for our monsters of the future, but also on the actual monster selection itself. We did both primary (done with a user survey) and secondary research to determind the most fitting selection of monsters for our timeline, along with visual and format inspirations for the timeline itself. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Process Documentaion </h2>
                    <p> I started by drawing out a quick rough sketch concept of our timeline with a monster selection we had at the time. This concept was a linear line but had all the basic ideas for imagery on the timeline. </p>
                    <p> Next we find and think of as a group what kind of timeline format/style we'd want. We floated around different ideas, like a circle-based planet orbit idea, before landing on a spiral shape to represent the cultural ouroboros of the concept of monsters, and I would make a coloured concept of the spiral timeline. After adjustments to the spiral itself were made (like making it tilted for added depth and focus) and a new monster selection I was able to finish our monster timeline spiral. Each monster is represented by a unique single colour for themselves. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Results </h2>
                    <p> We were able to finish in time for the spookiest day of the year! Our full group "A Monstrum Continuum" presentation was received super positively by our audience with all of its other components along with the spiral timeline, with it reminding someone of "avant-garde from the 2000s" for example. It was able to stand out by being the only spiral timeline among other groups' line timelines, and I also made it super detailed to make it the most effective when printed at the large scale these timelines are gonna be printed at. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Reflection and Learnings </h2>
                    <p> Our timeline and project storytelling went really well for this ghoulicious group project! One thing we could've done different with the spiral timeline was make it more image collage-y and added text to it if I had more time to draw it. We learned a lot of phylisophical things about the nature of humanity and how it mirrors and personifies fear from this, but for something less phylisophical then I personlly learned that I could make an illustrated timeline as big as that in as little time as it did. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                    <p> In closing, our spooky spiral timeline was one main component in our monster presentation on Halloween that stood out from the crowd and made them in awe. But you don't need to wait until next Halloween to contact me for a custom creative commision however! </p>
